A Python-based expense tracker for college students.
# College Student Expense Tracker

Inspired by my own inability to track finances stepping out of the home nest as a freshman, starting on exel but unaware of categories, to paying for apps for this purpose, I created the **College Student Expense Tracker** is a Python-based tool designed to help college students manage their income, expenses, and savings. It simplifies budgeting and financial tracking, allowing students to focus on their academic and personal goals without worrying about finances.

## Features
- **Income Tracking**:
  - Track various income sources, including parental support, student loans, scholarships, on-campus jobs, and internships.

- **Fixed Expense Tracking**:
  - Record fixed monthly costs such as housing, dining plans, subscriptions, credit card payments, and savings goals.

- **Variable Expense Tracking**:
  - Add flexible expenses like dining out, entertainment, transportation, and other categories.

- **Monthly Budget Setup**:
  - Set up a monthly budget at the beginning of the month to plan expenses and savings effectively.

- **Detailed Summaries**:
  - View total income, fixed expenses, variable expenses, and remaining budget.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**:
   - At the start of the month, input your fixed expenses (housing, dining, subscriptions, etc.) and your savings goal.
2. **Track Income and Expenses**:
   - Add income sources and expenses as they occur.
3. **View Summaries**:
   - Monitor your spending habits and remaining budget.
4. **Save Data**:
   - All data is saved to a CSV file for persistence.
